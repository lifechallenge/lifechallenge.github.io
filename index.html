            <p>The objective of the LIFE Games is to develop student-led projects responding to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that may be implemented at the conclusion of the games.
            The final project must seek and achieve substantial impact within a clearly defined aspect of an SDG. Three elements must be incorporated in the project to secure impact: advocacy; behavioural change; and originality. Projects may range from the creation of campaigns, technological solutions, on- or offline programmes or social enterprises. Across all project end results, a campaign name, hashtag, and promo video will be expected.</p>
          <div>
            <p>
            The winning teams will receive funding for their Global Concern (GC) or the NGO/cause of their choice, as well as incubator training. Finalist teams will benefit from discussions with potential investors and a platform to present their project plans such that they may be refined and taken forward beyond the game.
